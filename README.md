**Kurakoo is a website where you can make friends (safely) and learn more from people you trust.** It is an online community of people providing answers to questions, just like 'Quora'. **Kurakoo** is specially catered to meet the needs of school/college students. Students from different colleges/universities around the world visit **Kurakoo to ask questions to a community of people who are always ready to answer them.**


## Project Background💡

In the majority of the colleges and universities across India, thousands of students have many doubts and queries from **"Which branch to choose?"** to **"How to crack interviews?"**. Kurakoo is a one-stop solution for all these problems. It serves as a platform where students can drop in their questions for public view and any person from this vibrant community can help by providing answers to these questions. 


## Areas of Collaboration 👨‍🏭

Project Managers, Developers and Designers would be collaborating on various domains like:

-   **UI Prototyping** with figma tool [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/1gYZlafa8bUZu61ji10unF/Kurakoo?node-id=0%3A1).
    
-   **Front-End Development with ReactJS**
    
-   **Developing Backend APIs with NodeJS and MongoDB**
    
-   **Working on a NoSQL Database Management System**
    
-   **Working on a User-Experience rich platform for a Social Cause**
    

This would be an enriching experience for all Student Developers, Project Managers and Designers.


## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Coding Languages**: Javascript (MERN Stack)

- **Tools & Technologies**: React, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS

- **Project Management Tools**: Trello, Git/Github, Markdown (Documentation)

## Flow of the site :computer:
Below is a basic idea as to how the website works. We will also be working on adding more features to this project, like sharing of questions, an option to follow people, a feature that allows users to filter and view specific content, etc.
