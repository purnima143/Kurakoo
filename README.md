**Kurakoo is a website where you can make friends (safely) and learn more from people you trust.** Kurakoo is an online community of people providing answers to questions just like Quora site. **Kurakoo** is especially for school-college students, people from around the different colleges visit **Kurakoo to ask questions from a community of people who answer them.**


## Project Background💡
